AI Practicum Final Project

This is a Wordle Solver. We want to learn the best practices that are useful to solve Wordle and make a solver that is more efficient and accurate than humans.

We would like to use reinforcement learning to train our solver. Hopefully, the solver learns and is able to solve the puzzle faster and in less guesses than a human player. We are thinking of having the solver play against humans of varying skill levels of which will be determined by how long they have been playing Wordle and the distribution of their number of guesses.
